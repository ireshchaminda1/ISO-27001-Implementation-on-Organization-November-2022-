# ISO-27001-Implementation-on-Organization-November-2022-

We interviewed numerous key stakeholders as part of the security assessment for hypothetical organization known as "Walltone Security Company" in order to evaluate the organization's current security level and study the relevant paperwork and policies. After mapping interview and document analysis results to ISO/IEC 27001:2013 controls, we assessed the present condition of the Information Security Management Framework's implementation. In order to bring security controls up to the recommended level of maturity and hence address technical components of ISO/IEC 27001 compliance, we advise Walltone Security Company to begin implementing them one at a time.
